# Newtonian Gravitation Simulation
https://vivswan.github.io/NGS/

To determine the path of the moon with respect to the sun. The path of the moon with respect to the earth is elliptical and path of the earth with respect to the sun is elliptical. For this the simulation is created which use the Newtonian Universal Laws of Gravitation and traces the path of the moon. The final path of the moon is shown in graph 9. In graph 14, the clear nature of the moon path is seen.
